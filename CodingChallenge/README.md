# **Coding Challenge - ME Bank**

This a git repository for Junior Software Developer Application Coding Challenge. This program is to implement a system that analyses financial transaction records. It would take in csv file which will include multiple transaction records describing transferring money from one account to another account.
## `Setup`
This project was developed using Java 1.8 (Java 8) and will require installation of the Java Runtime Environment in order to run, and the Java Development Kit to contribute to. The relevant libraries: OpenCSV; are all included in the /lib/ folder of the repository. They should be added to the project build path using an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

##**Tests**
All the test files are in the Tests' folder of the repository. The program's main file takes a particular test file by initialising its path. If we want to test on different file for different test cases all we have to do is change the file name or by providing its path on line 12 in the program.
